# Principles of Quantum Computing;

A quantum computer operates based on fundamental quantum principles, necessitating a unique set of terms for comprehensive understanding. Key principles include:

## 1. Superposition:
   - **Definition:** Superposition states that, akin to waves in classical physics, you can add two or more quantum states, yielding another valid quantum state.
   - **Explanation:** Quantum computers leverage superposition of qubits, allowing them to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This inherent parallelism enables quantum computers to process millions of operations at the same time.


## 2. Entanglement:
   - **Definition:** Quantum entanglement occurs when two systems become closely linked, such that knowledge about one system immediately imparts knowledge about the other, regardless of the distance between them.
   - **Explanation:** Quantum processors can draw conclusions about one particle by measuring another, indicating a high degree of correlation. Entanglement facilitates solving complex problems faster in quantum computers.


## 3. Decoherence:
   - **Definition:** Decoherence refers to the loss of the quantum state in a qubit.
   - **Explanation:** Environmental factors, like radiation, can cause the quantum state of qubits to collapse. Engineering a quantum computer involves addressing decoherence challenges, such as designing structures to shield qubits from external fields.

***Understanding these principles—superposition, entanglement, and decoherence—is crucial for comprehending the unique capabilities and challenges inherent in quantum computing.***
