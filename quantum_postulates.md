postualates of quantum computing in easy language to understand


The postulates of quantum computing describe the principles that make quantum computing possible based on quantum mechanics. Some of these postulates are:
# Short term:
  - Superposition: A quantum bit (qubit) can be placed in more than one state.

  - Entanglement: A quantum bit can be entangled with another quantum bit.

  - Indeterminacy: A quantum bit cannot be measured more than once.

  - These postulates are crucial for quantum computing. Here is a more detailed explanation of each 
    postulate:

  - Superposition: A qubit can exist in multiple states at the same time, unlike a classical bit that 
    can only be in one state at a time. This means that a qubit can represent multiple values at the 
    same time, rather than just a single value like a classical bit.


- Entanglement: When two qubits are entangled, they become correlated in such a way that the state of 
  one qubit depends on the state of the other qubit. This correlation persists even if the qubits are 
  separated by a large distance.


- Indeterminacy: When a qubit is measured, it collapses into one of its possible states. However, the 
  state that it collapses into cannot be predicted with certainty. Instead, the probability of the 
  qubit collapsing into a particular state can be calculated.
