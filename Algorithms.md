- In 1994, MIT Maths Professor Peter Shor developed a quantum algorithm for efficiently generating prime factors of large numbers.
- Shor's algorithm solves prime factors in polynomial time, enabling factorization into prime numbers in O(logN^3) time and O(logN) space.

# Explanation of Shorâs Algorithm
- Prime factorization has been historically challenging.
- The Factoring Problem is unsolved in Computer Science; factorizing a 100-digit number may take years on traditional computers.
- Encryption algorithms like RSA rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.
- Shorâs algorithm, a quantum algorithm, could break such encryption.
- Requires a large set of quantum bits; attempts to implement it have been challenging.
- Key concept in post-quantum cryptography and Quantum hacking.

# Operational Efficiency
- Shorâs algorithm needs 10243 operations to factorize a 1024-bit number.
- Quantum computers running at 100 MIPS can achieve this in seconds.
- Utilizes 2 registers, with sizes 2048 and 1024 qubits, working coherently to achieve a single entangled state.

# Implications for Encryption
- Many encryption schemes assume large number factorization is infeasible in polynomial time.
- If solved, encryption algorithms like RSA could be compromised.
- This leads to the emergence of post-quantum cryptography as a countermeasure.

# Challenges and Future Trends
- Shorâs algorithm is considered one of the most challenging in quantum computing.
- Various attempts to implement it in quantum systems, but significant challenges remain.

# Conclusion
- Shorâs algorithm has profound implications for cryptography, posing challenges to traditional encryption methods and paving the way for quantum-resistant cryptography.
