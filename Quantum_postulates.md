## Postualates in  quantum computing :


*The postulates of quantum computing describe the principles that make quantum computing possible based on quantum mechanics. Some of these postulates are:*

# Fundamentals of Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a field of study that applies the principles of quantum mechanics to the design of computers. The foundation of quantum computing is built upon four postulates of quantum mechanics:

1. **Definition of a Quantum Bit (Qubit):**
   - A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, representing a two-state quantum-mechanical system.
   - It can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.

2. **Qubit Transformation (Evolution):**
   - The evolution of a qubit is described by a unitary transformation.
   - This transformation is represented by a matrix, commonly known as a quantum gate.

3. **Effect of Measurement:**
   - When a qubit is measured, its state collapses to one of its two possible states.
   - The probability of measuring a particular state is given by the square of the absolute value of the corresponding coefficient in the superposition.

4. **Combining Qubits into Systems:**
   - Multiple qubits can be combined to form a larger quantum system.
   - The state of the combined system is described by a tensor product of the individual qubit states.

These four postulates provide the framework for understanding the behavior and manipulation of qubits in quantum computing.
