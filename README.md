 ## Quantum Computing: A Beginner's Guide


- **Quantum computing is a modern way of computing that is based on the science of quantum mechanics. It is a combination of physics, mathematics, computer science, and information theory**

- **2. Unlike classical computers that use bits to process information, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in both the one and zero states at the same time
This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers**

- **Scientists have been working on developing quantum computers for several decades, and while there have been some breakthroughs, there are still many challenges that need to be overcome before quantum computers can become practical for everyday use**

- **Nonetheless, the field of quantum computing is rapidly advancing, and it will be exciting to see what the future holds for this technology.** ![image](https://github.com/Rjesh2006/Quantum_computing/assets/143868643/fc800a55-4c38-4664-9137-c6a4a6a9cd1a)

# Quantum mechanics:

- **Quantum mechanics is the area of physics that studies the behavior of particles at a microscopic level. At subatomic levels, the equations that describe how particles behave is different from those that describe the macroscopic world around us**

- **Quantum computers take advantage of these behaviors to perform computations in a completely new way.**
